# Abstract
This research addresses the challenges of predicting sales in media platform advertising expenditure by applying the Linear Regression algorithm to predict outcomes based on spending patterns. Achieving an outstanding 99% accuracy, the developed system offers businesses in the media industry a valuable tool to optimize advertising strategies and improve decision-making processes, highlighting the significance of using machine learning in sales prediction.
# Problem Statement
1. Inaccurate trend analysis in estimating advertising spend based on past performance may lead to wasteful expenditure, poor ROI, and missed growth opportunities for companies due to misrepresentation of advertisers and unawareness of consumer behavior changes. 
2. Lack of a standardized industry measurement for media platform advertising efficacy results in inefficient allocation of marketing funds, making it challenging for businesses to assess the effectiveness of different media types and select suitable variables and models for reliable sales forecasting. 
3. In the complex landscape of cross-channel impacts, businesses face challenges in effectively coordinating marketing efforts across various platforms, requiring an in-depth understanding of the unique capabilities of each channel to optimize strategies and performance.
# Objective
1. To study linear regression algorithm in sales prediction for media platforms’ advertising expenditure.
2. To develop a prototype of sales prediction for media platforms’ advertising expenditures using the linear regression algorithm.
3. To evaluate the accuracy of the linear regression algorithm in predicting the sales for the media platform’s advertising expenditure.
# Conclusion
In conclusion, our sales prediction system successfully met its objectives, utilizing Linear Regression on media platforms. The system, efficient in trend detection and decision-making for advertisers, demonstrates effective functionality. Acknowledging limitations, we suggest future improvements to refine the system and enhance its features, ensuring ongoing advancements in media platform sales prediction.
